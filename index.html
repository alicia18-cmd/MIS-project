            Our company, AC Recycled Dresses, is focused on working towards the sustainability goal of responsible consumption and production. Our company was founded by young fashion designer Alicia Cunha, who wanted to find a balance between sustainability and clothing. Founded in 2019, the company took off when the pandemic hit in 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
            In its early days, we only sold adult sized dresses, but now we have expanded to dresses of all sizes from infants to the elderly. Over the years, we have also diversified our designs and materials.
        </p>

        <p>
            Clients should do business with us because not only will you be purchasing chic clothing, but you will also be saving the planet one dress at a time! We source our materials locally and hire people from our community.
        </p>

        <p>
            From day one, we implemented a policy that if a dress does not sell within three months, we donate it to our local community. Unlike other businesses that put unsold clothes on sale, we believe in giving back. Our employees are trained through a process we call "Kindness and Caring for All," and our team is passionate and dedicated. We now have locations throughout New England.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below are a few of our most popular dress designs:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Red and white checkererd toddler dress</li>
            <li>Black spagetti strap maxi dress</li>
            <li>White linen long sleeve dress</li>
            <li>Red kids bow dress</li>
